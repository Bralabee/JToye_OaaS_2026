# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-04-14)

**Core value:** Vendors can manage their business end-to-end — from marketing to kitchen fulfilment — through a single platform with real-time visibility, running safely on verified infrastructure that can scale past one replica.
**Current focus:** Milestone v2.2 — 8 P2 security/quality items from deep-audit + Work Order E (vendor order detail + Stripe refund flow)

## Current Position

Phase: Not started (defining requirements → roadmap)
Plan: —
Status: v2.2 scoping — PROJECT.md updated, REQUIREMENTS.md + ROADMAP.md next
Last activity: 2026-04-18 — v2.2 scoping started

Progress: [░░░░░░░░░░] 0% (0/6 milestone-v2.2 phases complete — phases 12-17)

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**

- Total plans completed (M2): 10
- Average duration: —
- Total execution time: — hours

**By Phase (milestone 2 history):**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 1 | 1 | - | - |
| 2 | 1 | - | - |
| 3 | 2 | - | - |
| 4 | 1 | - | - |
| 5 | 1 | - | - |
| 6 | 1 | - | - |
| 7 | 1 | - | - |
| 8 | 2 | - | - |
| 11 | 3 | - | - |

**Recent Trend:**

- Last 5 plans: M2 phase 8 closure
- Trend: green; milestone 2 complete, milestone 3 roadmap ready

*Updated after each plan completion*

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [M2 Roadmap]: API versioning first — changes every URL, doing later means double rework
- [M2 Roadmap]: KDS split into 3 phases (security, pipeline, UI) — highest complexity feature, security must be proven before UI
- [M2 Roadmap]: Test coverage has no dependencies — can parallel any phase
- [M3 Scope]: Work Orders A+B+C only — A ships in 2 days as a safety net, B/C each ~1 week. Deferring D–O to keep the milestone bounded at ~2.5 weeks
- [M3 Scope]: Skip research — state-of-codebase doc is already research-grade with file:line evidence; phase-level research will cover framework-specific pitfalls (StompBrokerRelay, Alertmanager)
- [M3 Scope]: STOMP broker behind `stomp.broker.mode` config flag — keeps local dev on in-memory, staging/prod on RabbitMQ relay
- [M3 Roadmap]: Phase 9 (SECR) ships first as standalone safety net — no dependencies, 2 days, closes credential-exposure hole before B/C start
- [M3 Roadmap]: Phase 10 (STFR) is independent of 9 and 11 — can run in parallel with either
- [M3 Roadmap]: Phase 11 (STMP) depends on Phase 9 — STMP-05 reuses the Alertmanager + Slack route from SECR-04/SECR-05
- [M3 Roadmap]: One phase per work order (no splitting) — task breakdown fits cleanly, preserves audit traceability

### Pending Todos

- Complete v2.2 roadmap (phases 12–17 covering the 11 requirements)
- Run `/gsd-discuss-phase 12` once roadmap is approved (first phase: Spring security headers + CSP)
- Backfill `status: complete` frontmatter on the 5 quick-task SUMMARY.md files (Deferred Items below) during an early v2.2 housekeeping pass
- Commit `frontend/.env.local.example` placeholder hardening change (block-secrets hook prevents Claude from staging it — needs a manual commit outside Claude)

### Blockers/Concerns

- Port conflicts in dev env (frontend 3100 because MCP server holds 3000; Postgres 5432 shared with unrelated `dealflow_*` containers) — E2E smoke tests may need those containers stopped first
- Stripe refund API (VOPS-02) requires phase-level research into idempotency keys + webhook `charge.refunded` handling — treat as a design-gate before writing the controller
- K8s Sealed Secrets (INF-02) requires an operator install in the cluster + key rotation policy — not just a manifest change
- `/public/orders?email=` enumeration risk (deferred from v2.1) — still open; not in v2.2 scope but should be noted as a known vulnerability

## Deferred Items

Items acknowledged and deferred at milestone v2.1 close on 2026-04-18:

| Category | Item | Status |
|----------|------|--------|
| quick_task | 260414-fe3-frontend-security-and-tests | Complete (shipped PR #40); no frontmatter status field — tool reports "unknown" |
| quick_task | 260414-inf-infrastructure-hardening | Complete (shipped PR #40); no frontmatter status field — tool reports "unknown" |
| quick_task | 260414-j9c-edge-go-security-hardening-batch-phase-1 | Complete (shipped PR #40); no frontmatter status field — tool reports "unknown" |
| quick_task | 260414-jkp-java-core-data-integrity-batch-phase-2-o | Complete (shipped PR #40); no frontmatter status field — tool reports "unknown" |
| quick_task | 260414-ltc-low-touch-cleanup | Complete (shipped PR #40); no frontmatter status field — tool reports "unknown" |

All 5 are deep-audit P1 quick tasks that shipped in PR #40 on 2026-04-16. Work is done; only tooling metadata is missing. Consider adding `status: complete` frontmatter during v2.2 planning cleanup.
